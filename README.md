# SIFloatingCollection.Swift

SIFloatingCollection is a component that provides logic similar to Apple Music genres selection.

It uses SpriteKit to simulate physics similar to Apple Music genres selection bubbles. It's customizable, so you can create any floating shapes (triangles, squares or any other crazy form) containing any other SKNode instances.

To get animations, logic and almost exact physics as Apple Music has you can use code from example. Otherwise you can create any animations and logic you want based on abstractions of this component.
